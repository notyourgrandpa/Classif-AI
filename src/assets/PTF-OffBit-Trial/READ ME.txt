Notice to User - We offer you the opportunity to try out our trial font collection before you buy it because we know how important it is. By using the trial fonts, you are agreeing to use the fonts for testing and evaluation purposes only. Use on a personal project is permitted with attribution as long as it's not for commercial purposes. View the trial license for details.

TRIAL LICENSE
• You are not allowed to open, edit or otherwise modify the font.
• After buying fonts from this website you can only install them on 1 computer device.
• 1 Quantity when buying this font for 1 Computer installation.
• You can install it on another computer if you buy more than 1 Quantity
• “Converting to paths” and editing in a program such as Illustrator is permitted – just as long as the result is not converted back into font software for redistribution.
• Use of “converted to paths” type outlines for logos, headines etc is permitted.
• You are not allowed to redistribute the font.
• Editing and/or renaming the font is not permitted – this does not constitute creating an original font and does not negate the terms of the original license. Device can provide custom font design, adaption and related licensing for all your needs.
• Using elements of the font as a basis of a new font is not permitted.
• Respect copyright – the legal consequences of using unlicensed or adapted fonts can be very expensive and result in the enforced removal of all offending copies. Badly adapted fonts are often found to have a range of serious technical and design errors, the most common being missing kerning (contextual inter letter spacing), missing characters, poor spacing, incorrect point construction (leading to printing problems and distorted character shapes), font ID clashes and missing counters due to incorrect path directions.
• Violation of the license will be charged 10 times the actual license price.
• Be legal, be safe.
• If there is something you still don’t understand, please Contact us
